# Machine Learning Projects
These projects cover the following concepts:
+ Data manipulaton
+ Data visualization
+ Model building and evaluation
+ Data prediction with a ML model

## Cancer Type Classifier
This project aims to employ a machine learning algorithm to predict the cancer type in patients based on gene expression data obtained from an RNA-Seq analysis. This project demonstrates the application machine learning and bioinformatics could have for cancer detection. The data came from the [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/401/gene+expression+cancer+rna+seq)

Includes:
+ ipynb file of the full end-to-end code

## CA Housing Value Predictor
This project aims to employ a machine learning algorithm to predict median houseing values in Californian districts given a number of housing attributes. This model could be useful in aiding either sellers in properly listing a house or buyers in establishing a realistic price for a property.

Includes:
+ ipynb file of the full end-to-end code
+ csv file of the data (data was provided by Eastern University)

## Drug Efficacy Predictor
This project aims to create a machine learning model that is able to take as input a chemical compund in SMILE format, and predict its IC50 value in regard to targeting the AMyloid-beta A4 protein. This protein is a hallmark of the Alzheimer's disease due to its overexpression within neural pathways.

Includes:
+ 4 ipynb files of code
+ 7 csv files of the data from varying steps in the ML process (inital data was obtained from [ChEMBL](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/g/#search_results/targets/query=amyloid%20beta))
+ smi file of SMILES
+ xml file of Pubchem descriptors

## Solubility Predictor
This project aims to create a machine learning model that is able to take as input a chemical's molecular descriptors and predict its logS or its solubility value. Solubility plays a vital role in drug development, so this model could aid researchers in developing more bioavailable drugs.

Includes:
+ 2 ipynb files of the code
+ 2 csv files of data from varying steps in the ML process (initial data was provided by [the data professor](https://github.com/topics/data-professor))
