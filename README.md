# Projects

## Drug Efficacy Predictor
This project aims to create a machine learning model that is able to take as input a chemical compund in SMILE format, and predict its IC50 value in regard to targeting the AMyloid-beta A4 protein. This protein is a hallmark of the Alzheimer's disease due to its overexpression within neural pathways.
+ Data manipulaton
+ Data visualization
+ Data prediction with a regression model
+ Regression model evaluation


## Solubility Predictor
This project aims to create a machine learning model that is able to take as input a chemical's molecular descriptors and predict its logS or its solubility value. Solubility plays a vital role in drug development, so this model could aid researchers in developing more bioavailable drugs.
